#Driver configuration

In Carina WebDriver is initialized by method **getDriver()**.
It will create a WebDriver named "default" with capabilities from _config.properties.
With a help of this method we also can launch several automation sessions with different capabilities and browser options

Currently supported browsers by Carina:

* Chrome
* Firefox
* Microsoft Edge
* Opera
* Safari

##Carina's webdriver initialization
WebDriver can be created in several ways:

* **getDriver(String name).**

In this case we may need to specify -Dwebdriver when launching selenium server. If there is no driver in Driver pool with name we passed Carina will create a new WebDriver with capabilities from _config.properties file. We can access the driver by his name. By using different names we can create several Automation sessions.

* **getDriver()**

In this case we need to specify -Dwebdriver when launching selenium server. The driver's name will be setted as "default". So it means that we can access this driver by calling method getDriver() or getDriver("default"). If default driver is null Carina will initialize new driver with capabilities from _config.properties file.

* **getDriver(String name, DesiredCapabilities capabilities).**

In this case we will use our custom capabilities. There are two ways: 
1) Use Carina's capabilities templates for different browsers.
2) Describe DesiredCapabilities inside your program javaTest.class. 

###Carina's capabilities templates:
```java
getDriver("chrome", new ChromeCapabilities().getCapability("Chrome Test"))
getDriver("firefox", new FirefoxCapabilities().getCapability("Firefox Test"))
getDriver("safari", new SafariCapabilities().getCapability("Safari test"))
getDriver("edge", new EdgeCapabilities().getCapability("Edge test"))
getDriver("opera", new OperaCapabilities().getCapability("Opera test"))
```
You can decide the max number of drivers by parameter **max_driver_count** in **_config.properties**. By default it's 3.
New driver could be accessed by name.
```
getDriver("safari");
```

###Creating custom capabilities:
``` java
DesiredCapabilities capabilities = DesiredCapabilities.safari();
capabilities.setBrowserName("safari");
capabilities.setCapability(CapabilityType.PLATFORM_NAME, SpecialKeywords.MAC);
HomePage safariHomePage = new HomePage(getDriver("safari",capabilities));
safariHomePage.open();
Assert.assertTrue(safariHomePage.isPageOpened());
```

List of all selenium [capabilities](https://github.com/SeleniumHQ/selenium/wiki/DesiredCapabilities).

* **getDriver(String name, DesiredCapabilities capabilities, String seleniumHost).**

 There we also need to pass selenium server host. In case of seleniumHost == null Carina will use your _config.properties selenium_host parameter.
 
 ###Additional capabilities

There is also a possibility to send additional capabilities to Carina through _config.properties. All parameters with prefix **capabilities.** will be added to the driverâ€™s capabilities.
```
capabilities.platformName=MAC
```

##Options 

Options are used to tune your browser for tests.
``` java
DesiredCapabilities capabilities = DesiredCapabilities.safari();
capabilities.setBrowserName("safari");
capabilities.setCapability(CapabilityType.PLATFORM_NAME, SpecialKeywords.MAC);
ChromeOptions options = new ChromeOptions();
options.addArguments("--no-first-run");
options.addArguments("--disable-notifications");
capabilities.setCapability(ChromeOptions.CAPABILITY,options);
HomePage safariHomePage = new HomePage(getDriver("safari",capabilities));
safariHomePage.open();
Assert.assertTrue(safariHomePage.isPageOpened());
```
Options also could be setted through _config.properties. If there are multiple options to pass split them by comma. Available parameters to pass options:
```
chrome_args=
chrome_experimental_opts=
chrome_mobile_emulation_opts=
firefox_args=
firefox_preferences=
```
